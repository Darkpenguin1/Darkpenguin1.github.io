			<h2>Flores y Fresas</h2>
			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			<p>
				Application & Purpose: My application and its purpose is to promote an individuals flower business.
				The intended users of the application are potential customers that want to view the individuals work 
				in photo gallerys, and to improve awareness of the individuals business. For a user story
				an ideal customer is a user who is around there 20s who can navigate a application freely. 

				The overview of the content of the website is a about us page, stating how their business came into fruition. 
				Another feature of the application is a photo gallery of the individuals flowers and offerings. 
				The application will be able to filter the offerings of the users offerings for example 
				filtering between roses and sunflowers within a boquet. 
				Additional functionality of the application is that users could view upcoming sales of boquets or special offerings 
				in the application.

			<h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
			<p>
				The main dynamic functionality on the page is the filtering of images on pages. Using a drop down 
				to filter certain img ids from a page. A dynamic map that will show available pickup locations for 
				products. An example website that has this similar functionality is : <a href="https://www.proflowers.com/flowers/type/roses/all?q=&cid=pfseo&prid=followdts">Link</a>
				<br>
				A search bar that will search for keywords within the gallery to find boquets of a particular color or a deal. 
				The site that achieves this is the same as linked above.
