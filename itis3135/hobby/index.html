      <h2>What is Weight Lifting?</h2>
      <p>Weight Lifting sounds pretty straightforward...picking up weight, but it can be suprisingly complex. 
        Weight lifting entails strength training through a variety of forms of resistance such as free weights, bands or machines 
        to build muscle and improve physical wellness.
        
        
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Types of weight lifting?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Power Lifting:</strong> Involves lifting the most weight possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Bodybuilding:</strong> Involves lifting weight to maximize hypertrophy (growth) focusing on aesthetics and muscle definition.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Olympic Lifting:</strong> Involves two primary movements: the snatch and the clean & jerk. This type focuses on explosive power and technique.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello I am Frank! I started weight lifting around 2020 during the covid era in highschool.
        One day clocking 10 hour shifts on my xbox became mundane so I got attracted to fitness. 
        Fitness has become a essential and crucial part of my life as I have explored different types of weight lifting 
        such as the ones stated on the "home" page. My love for fitness is derived from the love of continuous improvement.
        Day after day putting in the work you can both visibly and mentally feel yourself getting better. 
        Wether it be increasing the amount of weight you are pushing or seeing a bicep vein the work is rewarding. 
        The way fitness impacts my daily life is that its something I complete everyday that is productive,  
        I could have an absolutely terrible day but at the very least I got a workout in which is better than most.

      <h2>Best Times to Workout</h2>
      <p>
        What time should you workout? The time you workout impacts so much more than you think. 
        If you go to the gym early in the morning and you are not a morning person more than likely you are 
        setting yourself up for failure. However also going to the gym at common times such as 5pm or 6pm
        you are going to be waiting a long time to do exercises that you want to do. The gym will be packed
        and you'll lose your muscle pump because of the amount of time you are waiting to use a machine or weight. 
        You CAN workout at night such as 8pm and onward but if you take caffeine such as preworkout you will be bouncing off the 
        walls trying to fall asleep. Caffeine takes a long time to clear from your system you have to be mindful of the amount and 
        time you consume it at. 

        <br>
        <br>

        Finishing this yap session what is the main take away?
        
        <br>

        The MAIN take away is that the best time to workout depends 100% on your situation when you work the best 
        and what other responsiblities you have to juggle alongside your weight lifting goals. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Why I Workout @ 7AM </h3>
      <p>
        I prefer working out at 7 AM because it sets me up for a productive day. The gym is less crowded, 
        and I can focus on my routine without long wait times for equipment. After my workout, I feel energized 
        and ready to tackle the rest of my day, whether it's classes or projects. Not only that but waking up at 
        6:30 forces me to sleep at a reasonable time and gives me something to look forward to when I begin each day.

      <h2>Where To Workout?</h2>
      <p>
        You Can Workout literally anywhere, the most common places are the gym and at home. 
        I personally started working out at home doing the basics: pushups, jumping jacks, squats and pullups with equipment.
        Moving to the gym a whole new world opens up, in this following sections I will be exploring the pros and cons
        of working out at the gym and at home!

      </div>
      <h3 class="section-header">At Home</h3>
      <p>
        Working out at home has numerous benefits varying from being in the privacy of your own home. 
        To not having to deal with some of the annoying social aspects such as loud grunting or weights falling to the ground. 
        Another benefit that working out from home has is that your home is always open and you can workout whenever, its not 
        like the gym where you have a time restriction. In the <q>When</q> section of my page I spoke about 
        the time you go to the gym and how much it matters because of how crowded the gym can get at times. 
        Well you never have to experience that when you are working out from home. Going to the gym or other 
        establishments costs money working out at home is 100% free with the exception of building a home gym
        and buying free weights you can get a perfectly good workout with just your body! 
        
        Working out from home is great however it does have some pitfalls such as, not being able to do certain exercises
        because of the lack of equipment. For example the amount of back exercises or leg exercises you can do is limited 
        when you are working out at home compared to the gym or another place with equipment. 
        Another downside of working out at home is the lack of social interaction, to some this may seem like a benefit
        but depending on your lifestyle if you are constantly alone being in a social space will boost your social life!

        The final con of working out at home are the distractions you are surrounded by them. At any time 
        you can walk up to your bed and nap completely ignoring your workout.

      <h3 class="section-header">The Gym</h3>
      <p> 
        Working out at the gym comes with its own set of advantages, primarily the wide variety of equipment available to target every muscle group. 
        Whether it's free weights, machines, or cardio equipment, the gym provides the tools to achieve a well-rounded workout. 
        Another significant pro is the professional atmosphere—the gym is a dedicated space for fitness, which can help mentally separate workout time from personal time. 
        Additionally, the gym often offers classes and group workouts that provide structure, guidance, and motivation, something you don't get when working out at home. 
        Having access to personal trainers also adds an element of expertise that can improve form and help you achieve your goals faster. 
        However, there are some drawbacks to working out in the gym as well. 
        One of the most common is the time commitment—getting to and from the gym can take time out of your day, not to mention gym hours and membership fees. 
        It can also get crowded, especially during peak hours, which may limit access to equipment or make the experience less enjoyable. 
        Some gyms may not be as clean as you'd like, or you might find it uncomfortable sharing equipment with others. 
        Another downside is the pressure of gym culture; for some, the social aspect of the gym can be intimidating, making it harder to focus or feel confident during workouts. 
        Lastly, depending on your goals, the gym might not always provide the quiet, personal environment some people need to fully concentrate on their workout.

      <h2>How To Get Started?</h2>
      <p>
        You can get started working out in either settings stated in the previous section (at home/gym). 
        Now that you are there you may be asking yourself, what now? 
        Firstly to begin I would reccomend creating goals or a plan for why you are working out and what you want to achieve.
        Lifting weights without a goal is still great for your health and general wellness but it is similar to driving 
        without a destination. 

        Often times when people get started within the gym they create a workout plan/split. 
        A workout schedule that can be easily repeated and works well with there body. The most common 
        workout splits are in table below.

      <h3 class="section-header">I Made My Plan What Now?</h3>
      <p>
        After you have made your plan all you have to do is take the first step. Workout, just do the thing! 
        You dont always have to stick to the exercises within your workout plan because you are likely a begginer
        find the exercises that are fun and beneficial to you! If you have any questions about your form 
        on a particular exercise the easiest thing to do is to look up a video on correct form for the exercise 
        you have questions about, and videotape yourself doing the same exercise to compare and contrast the two. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-header">Compound Movements</h3>
      <p>
        Compound movements are the movements you should prioritize earlier on within your exercise. Why? Because 
        They work multiple muscles in one movement. Putting more energy towards these compound movements will 
        get the most bang for your buck energy wise. The 3 main compound movements you should seek to master are the following
        Squat, Bench and Deadlift.
